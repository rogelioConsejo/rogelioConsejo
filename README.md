# Hello World, I'm Rogelio Consejo 👋

## About Me

I have experience in Google Ads & Analytics management and integrations, web development using PHP, Javascript, React, and Angular, as well as back-end development using Golang and Typescript. I'm particularly passionate about Clean Code and Clean Architecture, TDD, lean, and kanban.

## Interests

In my free time, I enjoy feeding my cats, spending time with my cats and being a humble servant to my cats 🐈🐈🐈🐈. I also like to watch documentaries and online courses or just going out for a walk. I'm also a big fan of the hacker's manifesto and how it has inspired me since I was a child, from the beauty of its words to the power of its ideas. A relic of an old world when using the internet would tye up the phone line.

> "This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like." - The Hacker's Manifesto
